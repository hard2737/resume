### About David Hardy

#### Professional, Tooling, Architecture, etc.

I am a consummate student of language and culture. Syntax, diction, and prose permeate the software and adjoining real world. From an internship at a startup to a career track with Microsoft, I’ve learned the importance of technical skills, debugging/troubleshooting, and a wholeness of professionalism that elevates this Senior Software Development Engineer to a broader understanding of delivering quality software. Software’s globalization/localization/internationalization concerns are something I particularly took ownership of driving while working at Microsoft. Consulting fortified my full stack architectural understanding; I implement in the given environments based on customer requirements. At Intuit I grew my love of React, whereas now I'm almost disgusted by the jQuery code that served web developers well for so long. TypeScript-based React code was the next evolution of affirming Atwood's Law, of which I am firm believer. Now, NextJS is a delightful opinionated, thoughtfully architected, framework that advances the React library to a full stack apparatus for rapid web application development. I rather enjoy Linux, Windows, and MacOS. I am very capable in .NET (C#), shell scripting (zsh, Powershell, or dos batch), and Node.

I use Vim every day. While it’s seemingly an ancient editor, it’s an extremely powerful tool with the capacity for sed and regular expression search and replace without wasting time with a mouse. I use vimium in my browser and the vscodevim extension in VS Code. I consider Beyond Compare to be the best diff utility as it is superior utility for reviewing pull request patches, plain text, and binary formats such as images, PDFs, MS Word documents and spreadsheets.

My overt sparing use of a mouse, in favor of my predilection for the keyboard, has lead me to an interest in Accessibility standards. Hot Keys and Keyboard Accelerators are important to a wide array of users. The vision impaired need to be able to navigate the web, just as those with no vision impairment. While a rising tide lifts all boats, so do a11y standards make adherent sites inherently more usable for all users. Just as [curb ramps at intersections](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/guides/chapter-4-ramps-and-curb-ramps/#curb-ramps-at-intersections) serve people in wheel chairs, parents with baby strollers, and cyclists, so is it true that a more accessible web drives elegant UI designs that make interfacing with sites smoother for all users.

Be it Quality Assurance, Software Configuration Management or Release Management, or feature design, architecture, and development — I've worked in every phase of the software development lifecycle. I've mentored junior developers, mirroring the wealth of knowledge I've gleaned from my tech elders. I'm proud to be part of the professional software development ilk, kith and kin.

I bring levity, mirth, and technical prowess to any organization in which I work. I have a clear and distinct tendency to jump into any task tossed my way with a growth mindset. I have very little interest in managing people and favor remaining an proficient individual contributor.

#### Personal

I am a husband, father, and friend first. I enjoy cooking, snowboarding, soccer, hiking, cycling, hunting, and dirt-biking. I am a thrill seeker: I enjoy sky-diving and roller-coasters. I love both ribaldry and reverence. Civil rights are important to me and my life is enriched greatly by a motley crew of friends spanning different races and religions. My reputation proceeds me, usually positively, but not always, because we're all always growing (hopefully for the better). I tinker with most technology I encounter (I may have too many Raspberry Pis).
