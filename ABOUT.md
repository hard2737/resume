### About David Hardy

#### Professional, Tooling, Architecture, etc.

I am a consummate student of language and culture, with a deep understanding of how syntax, diction, and prose permeate both software and the real world. From an internship at a startup to a career with Microsoft, Xtreme Consulting, and Intuit, I have learned the importance of technical skills, debugging/troubleshooting, and a holistic approach to professionalism. This experience has elevated my perspective as a Senior Software Development Engineer, enhancing my ability to deliver quality software.

At Microsoft, I took particular ownership of driving software globalization, localization, and internationalization efforts. Consulting further strengthened my full-stack architectural understanding, enabling me to implement solutions based on customer requirements in various environments.

At Intuit, I developed a strong affinity for React, and now I find myself less impressed by the jQuery code that once served web developers well. TypeScript-based React code represents the next evolution in line with Atwood's Law, which I firmly believe in. Currently, Next.js stands out as a delightful, opinionated, and thoughtfully architected framework that advances React into a full-stack solution for rapid web application development.

I enjoy working with Linux, Windows, and macOS, and I am highly skilled in .NET (C#), shell scripting (zsh, PowerShell, or DOS batch), and Node.js.

I use Vim every day. While it may seem like an ancient editor, it is an extremely powerful tool with the capacity for sed and regular expression search and replace, all without needing a mouse. I also use Vimium in my browser and the vscodevim extension in VS Code. I consider Beyond Compare to be the best diff utility, as it is superior for reviewing pull request patches, plain text, and binary formats such as images, PDFs, MS Word documents, and spreadsheets.

My overt limited use of a mouse, in favor of a keyboard-centric approach, has led me to an interest in accessibility standards. Hotkeys and keyboard accelerators are important for a wide array of users. Those with vision impairments need to be able to navigate the web just as easily as those without such impairments. While a rising tide lifts all boats, accessibility standards make compliant sites inherently more usable for all users. Just as [curb ramps at intersections](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/guides/chapter-4-ramps-and-curb-ramps/#curb-ramps-at-intersections) serve people in wheelchairs, parents with baby strollers, and cyclists, a more accessible web promotes elegant UI designs that enhance the experience for all users.

Be it Quality Assurance, Software Configuration Management, Release Management, or feature design, architecture, and development, I’ve worked in every phase of the software development lifecycle. I’ve mentored junior developers, reflecting the wealth of knowledge I’ve gained from my tech elders. I’m proud to be part of the professional software development community—my kith and kin.

I bring levity, mirth, and technical prowess to any organization in which I work. I have a clear and distinct tendency to dive into any task that comes my way with a growth mindset. I have very little interest in managing people and prefer to remain a proficient individual contributor.

#### Personal

I am a husband, father, and friend first. I enjoy cooking, snowboarding, soccer, hiking, cycling, hunting, and dirt-biking. I am a novice apiarist. I am a thrill-seeker: I love skydiving and roller coasters. I appreciate both ribaldry and reverence. Civil rights are important to me, and my life is greatly enriched by a diverse group of friends spanning different races and religions.  I tinker with most technology I encounter (I may have too many Raspberry Pis).
