$$ \colorbox{red}{hello world} $$


More to play with, but probably not, color doesn't shine through:

<object type="image/svg+xml">

     xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
     width="100" height="50"
>
  <text font-size="16" x="10" y="20">
    <tspan fill="red">Hello</tspan>,
    <tspan fill="green">world</tspan>!
  </text>
