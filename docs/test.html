        // Access to image at 'file:///path/to/vcard.jpg' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy:
        // Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data,
        // isolated-app, chrome-extension, chrome, https, chrome-untrusted.
        // More on isolated-app:
        // https://github.com/WICG/isolated-web-apps/blob/main/Scheme.md
        //    "Isolated Web Apps bundle all their contents inside a web bundle that is then signed to make its integrity verifiable.
        //    A key difference between Isolated Web Apps and normal web pages is that Isolated Web Apps do not rely on DNS name
        //    resolution and HTTPS certificate authorities. Instead, they need to be explicitly downloaded and installed by the
        //    user, such as from an app store or via enterprise configuration. A user agent can verify the integrity of an
        //    Isolated Web App by checking the signature and comparing its corresponding public key to a list of known trusted public keys."
        // So, the image is not loaded and the canvas is empty. You would see the error in the console.
        // To fix this, we can use a hosted image and set the crossOrigin attribute to 'anonymous'.
        // and the image is loaded and the canvas is drawn.
